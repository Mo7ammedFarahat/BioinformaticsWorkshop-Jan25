# Day 2: Introduction to R Programming Language

Welcome to Day 2 of the R course! This section provides an in-depth introduction to the R programming language, covering installation, syntax, data manipulation, visualization, and basic statistics.

## R & R Studio Installing

To start using R, you need to install both R and RStudio.  
1. **Installing R**: Visit [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/), choose your operating system, and follow the installation instructions.  
2. **Installing RStudio**: Visit [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), download the IDE, and install it.

## Basic Syntax

R uses a simple syntax for programming. Here's an example:

```R
# Basic arithmetic
2 + 3     # Addition
10 - 5    # Subtraction
4 * 6     # Multiplication
20 / 4    # Division

# Assigning values to variables
x <- 10
y <- 5
z <- x + y
print(z)  # Output: 15
```

## R Reserved Words

Reserved words are predefined keywords in R that you cannot use as variable names. Examples include `if`, `else`, `repeat`, `while`, `function`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`, etc.

## Variables

Variables in R store data values. You can assign values to variables using `<-` or `=`.

```R
# Assigning values
name <- "R Programming"
age <- 25
isStudent <- TRUE

# Displaying variable values
print(name)       # Output: "R Programming"
print(age)        # Output: 25
print(isStudent)  # Output: TRUE
```

## Types of Operators

R has several types of operators to perform different operations.

### Arithmetic Operators

```R
a <- 10
b <- 5
print(a + b)  # Output: 15
print(a - b)  # Output: 5
print(a * b)  # Output: 50
print(a / b)  # Output: 2
```

### Relational Operators

```R
a <- 10
b <- 5
print(a > b)   # Output: TRUE
print(a < b)   # Output: FALSE
print(a == b)  # Output: FALSE
print(a != b)  # Output: TRUE
```

### Logical Operators

```R
a <- TRUE
b <- FALSE
print(a & b)  # Output: FALSE
print(a | b)  # Output: TRUE
print(!a)     # Output: FALSE
```

### Assignment Operators

```R
a <- 10  # Assign value 10 to a
b <<- 20 # Global assignment
c = 30   # Assign value 30 to c
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
```

## Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the order of operations in an expression.

```R
result <- 10 + 5 * 2  # Multiplication happens first
print(result)         # Output: 20
```

## R Data Types

R supports various data types, such as logical, numeric, integer, complex, and character.

```R
x <- TRUE       # Logical
y <- 3.14       # Numeric
z <- 42L        # Integer
w <- 1+2i       # Complex
name <- "R"     # Character
```

## R Data Object Types

### Vectors

A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same type.

```R
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(vec)
```

### Matrices

A matrix is a two-dimensional array, where each element has the same data type.

```R
matrix <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
print(matrix)
```

### Lists

A list can hold elements of different types, such as vectors, numbers, or even other lists.

```R
my_list <- list("Apple", 42, TRUE)
print(my_list)
```

### Arrays

An array is similar to a matrix but can have more than two dimensions.

```R
arr <- array(1:8, dim = c(2, 2, 2))
print(arr)
```

### Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data and store the levels of a variable.

```R
factor_data <- factor(c("High", "Medium", "Low", "Medium"))
print(factor_data)
```

### Data Frames

A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column can contain different types of data.

```R
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob"),
  Age = c(25, 30),
  Gender = c("F", "M")
)
print(df)
```

## R Code Blocks

### Functions

Functions are used to group a set of instructions that can be called repeatedly.

```R
add <- function(a, b) {
  return(a + b)
}
print(add(5, 10))
```

### Packages

Packages in R extend the functionality of the base language.

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

## R File Manipulation

### CSV Files

You can read and write CSV files using `read.csv()` and `write.csv()`.

```R
data <- read.csv("file.csv")
print(data)
```

### Excel Files

To read Excel files, you can use the `readxl` package.

```R
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("file.xlsx")
print(data)
```

## R Data Visualization

### Pie Charts

Pie charts are used to show the proportions of a whole.

```R
slices <- c(10, 20, 30)
labels <- c("A", "B", "C")
pie(slices, labels)
```

### Bar Charts

Bar charts represent categorical data with rectangular bars.

```R
barplot(c(10, 20, 30))
```

### Boxplots

Boxplots visualize the distribution of a dataset, highlighting the median and outliers.

```R
boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data=mtcars)
```

### Histograms

Histograms represent the distribution of numerical data by dividing it into intervals.

```R
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

### Line Graphs

Line graphs are used to represent data points in a time sequence, or any other continuous data. They are particularly useful for visualizing trends over time or ordered categories.

```R
# Example of a simple line graph
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
plot(x, y, type = "o", col = "blue", xlab = "X-axis", ylab = "Y-axis", main = "Simple Line Graph")
```

### Scatterplots

A scatterplot is a diagram that represents the relationship between two variables by plotting data points. It helps to identify patterns, trends, or correlations between variables.

```R
# Example of a scatterplot
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19, xlab = "X-axis", ylab = "Y-axis", main = "Simple Scatterplot")
```

### ggplot

`ggplot2` is a powerful R package used for creating complex plots with simple code. It follows a grammar of graphics, allowing users to layer components of a plot.

```R
# Example using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of MPG vs Horsepower") +
  xlab("Miles Per Gallon (MPG)") + 
  ylab("Horsepower")
```

## R Basic Statistics

### Mean, Median, and Mode

- **Mean**: The average of a set of numbers.
- **Median**: The middle value when the numbers are sorted in ascending order.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

```R
# Example data
data <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Mean
mean_value <- mean(data)
print(mean_value)  # Output: 3.57

# Median
median_value <- median(data)
print(median_value)  # Output: 3

# Mode (custom function)
getmode <- function(v) {
  uniqv <- unique(v)
  uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}
mode_value <- getmode(data)
print(mode_value)  # Output: 2
```

### Normal Distribution

A **normal distribution** is a bell-shaped curve that represents the distribution of a dataset, where most of the data points are clustered around the mean. In R, you can simulate a normal distribution using the `rnorm()` function.

```R
# Generating a normal distribution
set.seed(123)
normal_data <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Visualizing the distribution
hist(normal_data, breaks = 30, col = "skyblue", main = "Normal Distribution", xlab = "Values")
```

### Binomial Distribution

A **binomial distribution** represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success.

```R
# Generating a binomial distribution
set.seed(123)
binomial_data <- rbinom(1000, size = 10, prob = 0.5)

# Visualizing the distribution
hist(binomial_data, breaks = 30, col = "green", main = "Binomial Distribution", xlab = "Number of Successes")
```

## Conclusion

In this continuation of Day 2, youâ€™ve learned about various data visualization techniques such as line graphs, scatterplots, and using `ggplot2`. We also covered basic statistics concepts like mean, median, mode, normal distribution, and binomial distribution. These fundamental concepts will help you analyze and visualize data efficiently in R.
